# BFSolver: Algorithms for Graded Semantics in Abstract Argumentation

University of Paris project that is a solver for graded and ranking-based semantics.

## Getting Started

First you'll need to install Maven Project Manager. If you're on Linux / Mac os, you can install it using your Package Manager. When Maven is installed, clone this repository by typing the following command :

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Dberrah/solver.git
  ```

## Solver requirements

This solver is following the Fourth International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation (ICCMA) Solver Requirements http://argumentationcompetition.org/2021/SolverRequirements.pdf.

## Use

To build and run the solver, please use build.sh or the snapshot in the target folder after building the project with maven.
